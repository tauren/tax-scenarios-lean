## Story 1.7: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployments

**Status:** Completed

**Story**
- As the project developer, I want a CI/CD pipeline configured (e.g., with Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Actions) so that automated builds and deployments of the application are triggered from the `main` branch, ensuring efficient and consistent releases.

**Dependencies**
- Story 1.0: Static Data - Required for initial project setup
- Story 1.1: App Shell - Required for basic application structure and build process
- Architecture Documents: Required for deployment strategy and CI/CD requirements

**Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**
1. ✅ The project's GitHub repository is successfully linked to the Cloudflare Pages service.
2. ✅ A CI/CD workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for GitHub Actions) is created and configured in the repository.
3. ✅ The CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers the build process (e.g., `npm run build`) upon commits or merges to the `main` branch of the repository.
4. ✅ A successful build in the CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the generated static assets (from the `dist` directory) to the production environment on Cloudflare Pages.
5. ✅ Basic deployment success and failure notifications are configured to inform the developer (e.g., via email or GitHub Actions status checks).
6. ✅ The CI/CD setup and deployment process aligns with the "Deployment Workflow (CI/CD Pipeline)" and "Rollback Strategy" sections outlined in the `architecture-lean-v1.2.md` document.

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] **Task 1: Configure Cloudflare Pages Project (AC: 1)**
    - [x] Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and create a new Pages project.
    - [x] Connect the project's GitHub repository to this Cloudflare Pages project.
    - [x] In the Cloudflare Pages project settings, configure the production branch to be `main`.
    - [x] Set the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) and the build output directory (e.g., `dist`) according to the Vite project configuration.
    - [x] Configure any necessary environment variables in Cloudflare Pages build settings if required by the Vite build process (though for MVP, these are expected to be minimal as per `front-end-architecture-v0.3.md`).
- [x] **Task 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow File (AC: 2, 6)**
    - [x] In the project repository, create a workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
    - [x] Define the workflow trigger: `on: push: branches: [ main ]`.
    - [x] Define a `build_and_deploy` job that:
        - Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
        - Includes steps to:
            - Checkout the code (`actions/checkout@vX`).
            - Set up Node.js (`actions/setup-node@vX` with a specified Node.js version, e.g., 20.x, matching local dev).
            - Install dependencies using `npm ci` (for reliable installs based on `package-lock.json`).
            - Optionally, run linters (e.g., `npm run lint`) and tests (e.g., `npm test`), ensuring the workflow fails if these steps fail.
            - Build the application (e.g., `npm run build`).
            - Deploy to Cloudflare Pages using the official Cloudflare Pages GitHub Action (`cloudflare/pages-action@vX`).
                - Configure the action with the Cloudflare API token and Account ID (from GitHub Secrets).
                - Specify the Cloudflare Pages project name.
                - Specify the build output directory (e.g., `dist`).
        - Refer to `architecture-lean-v1.2.md` (Section 10, "Deployment Considerations") for conceptual steps of the pipeline.
- [x] **Task 3: Configure GitHub Secrets for Cloudflare Deployment (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Generate a Cloudflare API token with appropriate permissions for Cloudflare Pages deployment.
    - [x] In the GitHub repository's settings, add this token as an encrypted secret (e.g., `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
    - [x] In the GitHub repository's settings, add your Cloudflare Account ID as an encrypted secret (e.g., `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).
- [x] **Task 4: Test CI/CD Pipeline (AC: 3, 4)**
    - [x] Make a small, non-critical change to the `main` branch (or create a test commit and push, or merge a test branch into `main` after initial setup).
    - [x] Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow run in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.
    - [x] Verify that all steps (checkout, setup, install, lint/test (if included), build, deploy) complete successfully.
    - [x] Verify that the application is successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages and the changes are live at the production URL.
- [x] **Task 5: Configure Basic Deployment Notifications (AC: 5)**
    - [x] Ensure that GitHub Actions status checks are visible on commits and pull requests related to the `main` branch.
    - [x] Configure email notifications (often a default setting in GitHub for workflow run status) or other preferred basic notification methods for build and deployment success/failure.
- [x] **Task 6: Verify Rollback Capability Awareness (Conceptual for this story - AC: 6)**
    - [x] As part of developer familiarization, review the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for the deployed project.
    - [x] Identify and understand how to access the deployment history and how to manually trigger a rollback to a previous successful deployment, aligning with the rollback strategy described in `architecture-lean-v1.2.md`. (No actual rollback needs to be performed unless a test deployment causes issues).

**Dev Technical Guidance**
-   **Official Documentation:** Heavily rely on the official Cloudflare Pages documentation for connecting GitHub repositories, configuring build settings, and understanding the `cloudflare/pages-action` GitHub Action. Also, consult GitHub Actions documentation for workflow syntax and managing secrets.
-   **Node.js Version Alignment:** Ensure the Node.js version specified in the `actions/setup-node` step of your GitHub Actions workflow matches the version used for local development (as specified in the `README.md` from Story 1.1).
-   **Package Installation in CI:** Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in the CI environment. `npm ci` performs a clean install based on `package-lock.json`, which is faster and ensures reproducible builds.
-   **Build Command and Output:** Double-check that the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) and the output directory (e.g., `dist`) configured in the Cloudflare Pages settings and the GitHub Actions workflow match your Vite project's configuration (`vite.config.ts` and `package.json` scripts).
-   **Secrets Security:** Emphasize that Cloudflare API tokens and Account IDs must be stored as encrypted secrets in the GitHub repository settings and accessed via `${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_NAME }}` in the workflow file. They should never be hardcoded.
-   **Iterative Testing:** It might take a few iterations of committing to `main` (or a test branch configured for deployment previews if set up) to get the CI/CD pipeline working perfectly. Start with a minimal viable workflow and add steps like linting and testing once basic deployment is functional.
-   **Cloudflare Pages Action:** Check the marketplace for the latest version of `cloudflare/pages-action` and its specific configuration options.
