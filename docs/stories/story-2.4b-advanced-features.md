## Story 2.4b: Implement Advanced Capital Gains Features

**Status:** Draft

**Story**
- As a user, I want the system to handle advanced capital gains tax scenarios, including gain bifurcation and special tax features, so I can accurately model complex tax situations.

**Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**
1. Gain Bifurcation:
   - The system correctly identifies and splits gains into:
     - Short-term gains (held â‰¤ 12 months)
     - Long-term gains (held > 12 months)
   - Different tax rates are applied to each category
   - The UI displays bifurcated gains separately
   - The calculation service handles partial year holdings

2. Special Tax Features:
   - The system supports:
     - Capital loss carryover between years
     - Netting of gains and losses within the same year
     - Special tax rates for specific asset types
     - Tax-free thresholds and exemptions
   - All special features are configurable per scenario
   - The UI clearly indicates when special features are applied

3. Enhanced Reporting:
   - Yearly projections include:
     - Breakdown of short-term vs long-term gains
     - Special tax feature impacts
     - Carryover amounts
   - Summary views show:
     - Total tax savings from special features
     - Impact of gain bifurcation on overall tax liability

**Tasks / Subtasks**
