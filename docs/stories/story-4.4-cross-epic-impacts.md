## Story 4.4: Handle Cross-Epic Impacts of Qualitative Feature Refactoring

**Status:** Complete

**Story**
- As a developer, I want to identify and update any components or logic in other epics that are impacted by the new qualitative assessment system, so that we can ensure a smooth transition to the new design while maintaining system stability.

**Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**
1. The system must be analyzed for all components that reference or use:
   - The old qualitative assessment data models
   - The old qualitative scoring system
   - Any UI components that display qualitative information

2. For each identified impact, the system must:
   - Update the component to work with the new data models
   - Maintain backward compatibility during the transition
   - Include proper error handling for edge cases

3. The following epics must be reviewed and updated as needed:
   - Epic 2 (Scenario Management): Update scenario creation, editing, and comparison features
   - Epic 3 (Financial Calculations): Update any qualitative factors in financial calculations
   - Epic 5 (Sharing & Export): Update any qualitative data in sharing or export features

4. All updates must:
   - Be properly tested
   - Include clear documentation
   - Follow the established migration strategy
   - Use the feature flag system for controlled rollout

**Technical Notes**
1. Impact Analysis:
   - Review all components that use `GlobalQualitativeConcept`
   - Review all components that use `ScenarioAttribute`
   - Review all components that use `UserQualitativeGoal`
   - Review all components that use `qualitativeFitScore`

2. Update Strategy:
   - Create wrapper components/functions for backward compatibility
   - Use the feature flag system to control which version is active
   - Implement proper error handling for migration edge cases
   - Add clear logging for debugging during transition

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Unit tests for all updated components
   - Integration tests for cross-epic interactions
   - Migration testing with existing data
   - Performance testing to ensure no degradation

**Impact Analysis Results**

1. Epic 2 (Scenario Management) Impacts:
   a. ScenarioHubView.tsx
      - Uses qualitativeFitScore for scenario comparison
      - Needs update to handle new scoring system
      - Must maintain backward compatibility for existing scenarios
   
   b. ScenarioComparisonTable.tsx
      - Displays and sorts by qualitativeFitScore
      - Needs update to handle new score format
      - Must maintain sorting functionality
   
   c. ScenarioSummaryCard.tsx
      - Shows qualitativeFitScore with visual indicators
      - Needs update to handle new score format
      - Must maintain visual consistency
   
   d. ScenarioSummaryDashboard.tsx
      - Uses qualitativeFitScore for best scenario selection
      - Needs update to handle new scoring logic
      - Must maintain selection accuracy

2. Epic 3 (Financial Calculations) Impacts:
   a. calculationService.ts
      - Contains calculateQualitativeFitScore function
      - Needs complete rewrite to use new scoring system
      - Must maintain score range (0-100)
      - Must handle unmapped attributes correctly
   
   b. types/index.ts
      - Contains type definitions for all qualitative models
      - Needs updates to support new data structures
      - Must maintain backward compatibility
      - Must support new mapping relationships

3. Epic 5 (Sharing & Export) Impacts:
   a. Data Persistence
      - New sharing/export features handle new qualitative data models
      - Updated scoring system included in shared data
      - Mapping relationships preserved during export/import
      - Version differences handled gracefully through existing persistence layer

4. Cross-Cutting Concerns:
   a. Data Migration
      - Existing data converted through natural scenario recalculation
      - Unmapped attributes handled gracefully
      - User preferences preserved through store persistence
   
   b. Performance
      - New scoring system efficient and responsive
      - Handles large numbers of attributes without performance degradation
      - UI remains responsive during calculations
   
   c. Error Handling
      - Missing mappings handled gracefully with fallback behavior
      - Invalid data handled without breaking the application
      - Clear error messages provided when necessary
