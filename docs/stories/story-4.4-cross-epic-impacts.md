## Story 4.3: Handle Cross-Epic Impacts of Qualitative Feature Refactoring

**Status:** Ready for Development

**Story**
- As a developer, I want to identify and update any components or logic in other epics that are impacted by the new qualitative assessment system, so that we can ensure a smooth transition to the new design while maintaining system stability.

**Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**
1. The system must be analyzed for all components that reference or use:
   - The old qualitative assessment data models
   - The old qualitative scoring system
   - Any UI components that display qualitative information

2. For each identified impact, the system must:
   - Update the component to work with the new data models
   - Maintain backward compatibility during the transition
   - Include proper error handling for edge cases

3. The following epics must be reviewed and updated as needed:
   - Epic 2 (Scenario Management): Update scenario creation, editing, and comparison features
   - Epic 3 (Financial Calculations): Update any qualitative factors in financial calculations
   - Epic 5 (Sharing & Export): Update any qualitative data in sharing or export features

4. All updates must:
   - Be properly tested
   - Include clear documentation
   - Follow the established migration strategy
   - Use the feature flag system for controlled rollout

**Technical Notes**
1. Impact Analysis:
   - Review all components that use `GlobalQualitativeConcept`
   - Review all components that use `ScenarioAttribute`
   - Review all components that use `UserQualitativeGoal`
   - Review all components that use `qualitativeFitScore`

2. Update Strategy:
   - Create wrapper components/functions for backward compatibility
   - Use the feature flag system to control which version is active
   - Implement proper error handling for migration edge cases
   - Add clear logging for debugging during transition

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Unit tests for all updated components
   - Integration tests for cross-epic interactions
   - Migration testing with existing data
   - Performance testing to ensure no degradation
