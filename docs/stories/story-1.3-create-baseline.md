## Story 1.3: Create Baseline Scenario & Input Core Data (CGT Focus)

**Status:** In Progress

**Story**
- As a user, I want to establish my "Baseline Scenario" within my Active Plan (from a CGT-focused template or custom), define its location, input gross income (for context), annual expenses, and my effective Capital Gains Tax rates for this baseline, so I have a foundational scenario.

**Dependencies**
- Story 1.0: Static Data - Required for `appConfigService.ts` and `templateScenarios` data
- Story 1.1: App Shell - Required for `UserAppState` interface and basic application structure
- Story 1.2: Asset Management - Required for `initialAssets` in `UserAppState`
- Architecture Documents: Required for `Scenario`, `ScenarioIncomeSource`, `AnnualExpense`, and `CapitalGainsTaxRate` interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**
1.  Within the "Active Plan," the user can initiate the creation or definition of the "Baseline Scenario."
2.  When establishing the Baseline Scenario, the user must be presented with options to either:
    a.  **Start from a Template:** Select from a list of available `templateScenarios` (sourced from `appConfig.templateScenarios`). Upon selection, a deep copy of the chosen `templateScenario` (including its predefined location name components, effective CGT rates, default expenses, qualitative attributes, etc.) becomes the user's Baseline Scenario within their Active Plan.
    b.  **Create a Custom Scenario:** Opt to create a custom Baseline Scenario. In this case, the user must input the location details: `displayLocationName` (e.g., "My Current US Setup"), `locationCountry`, `locationState` (optional), `locationCity` (optional). This custom scenario will start with empty or minimal default structures for income sources, annual expenses, and requires user input for effective CGT tax rates (as per AC.8 below).
3.  Regardless of the creation method (template or custom), the user can subsequently input and manage a list of `IncomeSource` objects for the Baseline Scenario. For each income source, the UI must allow specifying: Name (text input, required); Type (e.g., a dropdown with options "EMPLOYMENT," "RENTAL\_PROPERTY," "OTHER," as per `ScenarioIncomeSource` model in `architecture-lean-v1.2.md`); Annual Amount (numeric input, required); Start Year (numeric input, required, relative to the projection period); End Year (optional numeric input). (Note: `sourceJurisdictionInfo` on `ScenarioIncomeSource` is not utilized for MVP tax calculations by the core engine and may not have dedicated UI inputs in this story).
4.  The system provides an intuitive interface to add multiple income sources sequentially, edit existing income sources, and delete income sources for the Baseline Scenario.
5.  Regardless of the creation method, the user can subsequently input and manage `AnnualExpense` categories for the Baseline Scenario. (If created from a template, these might be pre-populated from the template's `annualExpenses.categories` and be editable). For each expense category, the UI must allow specifying: Name (text input, required); Amount (annual numeric input, required).
6.  Users can input a value for overall `annualExpenses.additionalCosts` (a lump sum for non-categorized annual costs) for the Baseline Scenario.
7.  The system provides an intuitive interface to add new expense categories, edit existing expense categories (names and amounts), and delete expense categories for the Baseline Scenario.
8.  For this Baseline Scenario, the user must be able to input their effective Short-Term and Long-Term Capital Gains Tax rates (e.g., into the `Scenario.capitalGainsTaxRates` array, which for MVP will hold a single object with these two rates, as per `architecture-lean-v1.2.md`).
9.  All entered/modified data for the Baseline Scenario is stored as part of the current "Active Plan" in the application's internal state (specifically, as the first element in `UserAppState.scenarios` if it's the first scenario, or clearly identifiable as baseline).
10. The UI for defining the Baseline Scenario and its core financials is responsive.
11. (Note: For a "custom" Baseline Scenario, fields for income tax rates, property tax, consumption tax are not used by the MVP engine. For a template-derived baseline, these rates are copied but also unused by the MVP engine).

**Visual & Layout Reference (Conceptual Mockup)**

**Important Visual Reference:** The following TSX mockup file (`scenario-editor-view.tsx`) provides a conceptual visual layout, component positioning, sizing, and styling guide for the UI elements relevant to this story (specifically for inputting baseline scenario details like location, income, expenses, and CGT rates, likely within a scenario editor interface). You should use this as a strong reference for the UI's appearance. However, implement the actual functionality, component structure, state management, and data flow strictly according to the detailed tasks in this story, the `front-end-architecture-v0.3.md`, `front-end-spec-v0.1.md`, and `architecture-lean-v1.2.md`.

**Mockup File:** `../../v0-mockups/components/scenario-editor-view.tsx`

**Critical Point:** The mockup designs provided may not contain every visual element described in this story. The mockups are not guarranteed to be feature complete. They should be used as a guideline and reference only. If this story specifies something is required that isn't in the mockup design, it still must be implmented.

4. Implement any remaining UI improvements

**Dev Technical Guidance**
-   **Visual Reference:** The `../../v0-mockups/components/scenario-editor-view.tsx` is the key visual guide for the forms and layout involved in editing scenario details.
-   **Data Models:** Refer to `Scenario`, `ScenarioIncomeSource`, `AnnualExpense`, `CapitalGainsTaxRate` interfaces in `architecture-lean-v1.2.md`.
-   **State Management (Zustand):**
    * The `UserAppState.scenarios` array will hold the `Scenario` objects. The Baseline is typically `scenarios[0]`.
    * Implement actions like `addScenario(scenario: Scenario, options?: {isBaseline?: boolean})`, `updateScenario(scenarioId: string, updatedData: Partial<Scenario>)`, and more granular actions like `updateIncomeSourceInScenario(scenarioId, incomeSourceId, updatedIncomeSource)`.
-   **UI Components:**
    * The `ScenarioEditorView.tsx` will be a significant component. Use ShadCN UI components extensively, guided by the mockup.
    * Consider how to structure `ScenarioEditorView.tsx` â€“ perhaps with tabs or collapsible sections for Core Details, Income, Expenses, etc., as suggested by `front-end-spec-v0.1.md`.
-   **Deep Copy for Templates:** Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(template))` or a similar robust deep copy method.
-   **Unique IDs:** Generate unique client-side IDs (UUIDs) for new Scenarios, IncomeSources, ExpenseCategories.
-   **CGT Rates:** For MVP, the `capitalGainsTaxRates` array in the `Scenario` model will hold one object with `shortTermRate` and `longTermRate`. The UI should reflect this simplicity for input.
