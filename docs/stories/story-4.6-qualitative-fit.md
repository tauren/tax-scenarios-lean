## Story 4.6: Implement Qualitative Fit Score

## Status: Complete

## User Story
As a user, I want to see a qualitative fit score for each scenario that considers my mapped attributes and their alignment with my personal goals, so I can quickly assess how well each scenario matches my preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The qualitative fit score calculation must:
   - Consider all mapped attributes and their alignment with user goals
   - Weight the score based on attribute significance and goal weight
   - Provide a clear 0-100 score that reflects overall fit
   - Update automatically when attributes are mapped/unmapped or goal weights change

2. The UI must:
   - Display the score prominently with clear labeling
   - Use color coding to indicate score ranges (red for low, yellow for medium, green for high)
   - Show a breakdown of how the score was calculated
   - Be responsive and maintain consistency with existing UI

3. The system must:
   - Recalculate scores when attributes are mapped/unmapped
   - Recalculate scores when goal weights change
   - Handle edge cases (no attributes, no goals, etc.)
   - Maintain performance with large numbers of attributes/goals

## Technical Notes
- Create a new `QualitativeFitScoreDisplay` component
- Update the `calculateQualitativeFitScore` function in the calculation service
- Add score recalculation triggers in the scenario editor
- Implement score breakdown view in a dialog
- Add appropriate tests for all new functionality

## Tasks
- [x] Update `calculateQualitativeFitScore` function to consider mapped attributes and goal weights
- [x] Create `QualitativeFitScoreDisplay` component
- [x] Implement score breakdown view in `ScoreBreakdownDialog`
- [x] Add score recalculation triggers
- [x] Add tests for score calculation
- [x] Add tests for UI components
- [x] Performance optimization for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Story 4.5 (Scenario Editor) must be completed first
- Story 4.4 (Goal Management) must be completed first
