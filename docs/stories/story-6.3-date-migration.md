## Story 6.3: Date Handling Migration and Backward Compatibility

**As a** developer
**I want** to ensure a smooth transition to the new date handling system
**So that** existing user data is preserved and the application remains stable during the transition

### Context
We need to handle the migration of existing data to the new date handling system while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Data Migration Layer**
   - [ ] Create `dateMigrationService.ts` with:
     - Function to detect string dates in existing data
     - Function to convert string dates to `Date` objects
     - Function to validate converted dates
   - [ ] Add migration logging and error handling

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - [ ] Update `localStorageService.ts` to handle both old and new formats
   - [ ] Update `planSharingService.ts` to handle both formats
   - [ ] Add version tracking for stored data

3. **Migration Process**
   - [ ] Create migration function to update existing localStorage data
   - [ ] Add migration status tracking
   - [ ] Add rollback capability
   - [ ] Add migration progress indicators

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add validation for migrated data
   - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Add user notification system for migration issues

### Technical Notes

1. **Migration Strategy**
   - Detect data format version
   - Convert string dates to `Date` objects
   - Validate converted data
   - Update version number
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for migration functions
   - Integration tests for data conversion
   - E2E tests for migration process
   - Error handling tests

3. **User Experience**
   - Silent migration where possible
   - Clear error messages if issues occur
   - Progress indicators for large migrations
   - Rollback instructions if needed

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Migration service is implemented and tested
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
- [ ] Migration process is reliable and tested
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] User experience is smooth
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
